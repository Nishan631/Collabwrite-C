# Collabwrite-C
CollabWrite-C is a multifunctional real-time collaborative text editor built in pure C using core DSA and networking concepts. It features a linked-list text buffer, undo/redo stacks, versioning with snapshots (tree), and multi-client TCP communication with thread-safe synchronization for concurrent editing.
# CollabWrite-C  
Multifunctional Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor using Data Structures and Algorithms in C  

# Overview

**CollabWrite-C** is a multifunctional, real-time **collaborative text editor** built purely in **C** using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts and **TCP networking**.  
It allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously and edit a shared text document in real-time.  

The project demonstrates the practical use of:
- **Linked Lists** â†’ for dynamic text buffer management  
- **Stacks** â†’ for Undo/Redo functionality  
- **Trees** â†’ for versioning and branching (snapshot storage)  
- **Threads & Mutexes** â†’ for concurrent client handling  
- **Sockets (TCP/IP)** â†’ for real-time networking and synchronization  

# Features

- Multi-user collaborative editing in real time  
- Linked-list-based text buffer for line-wise editing  
- Undo and Redo operations using stacks  
- Version control via snapshot tree (branching & restore)  
- Thread-safe synchronization using POSIX mutex locks  
- Multi-client communication with TCP sockets  
- Simple CLI command-based interface for users

# Supported Commands :-

1. INS <pos> <text>	Insert text at given position
2. DEL <pos> <len>	Delete a specific number of characters
3. UNDO	Undo the last operation
4. REDO	Redo the last undone operation
5. SNAP	Create a snapshot (version save)
6. LIST_VERSIONS	Show all saved versions in a tree structure
7. RESTORE <id>	Restore the document to a specific snapshot version
8. GET	Retrieve and print the current document
9. QUIT	Disconnect from the server

# Data Structures Used :-

Text Buffer	Doubly Linked List	Stores document line-by-line for efficient insertion/deletion
Undo/Redo	Stack	Stores previous operations for undo/redo actions
Versioning	Tree	Stores snapshots (each as a node), enabling branching and history
Networking	Threads + Mutex	Handles concurrent clients and synchronized edits

# Example Workflow :-
Client 1: INS 0 Hello

Client 2: INS 5 World

Both see â†’ Hello World

Client 1: DEL 5 6 â†’ Text becomes Hello

Client 2: UNDO â†’ Restores Hello World

Client 1: SNAP â†’ Saves version v1

Client 2: LIST_VERSIONS â†’ Displays snapshot tree

Client 1: RESTORE 1 â†’ Restores version v1

# Algorithmic Concepts :-
Linked List Traversal & Manipulation

Stack Push/Pop Operations

Tree Traversal for Version Listing

Mutex Locks for Critical Sections

Multi-threaded TCP Communication

DFS for Version Node Search

# Future Enhancements :-
ðŸ”¹ Merge functionality between versions
ðŸ”¹ File save/load (persistence)
ðŸ”¹ Authentication system (user-level sessions)
ðŸ”¹ GUI interface using ncurses or GTK
ðŸ”¹ Diff/merge algorithm for branch merging
ðŸ”¹ CRDT-based conflict resolution
